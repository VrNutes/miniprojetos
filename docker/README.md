## Why should I learn?

- It is the starting point of IaC (Infrastructure as Code)
- Quick way to create environments that can be reproduced easily on every machine

## Where should I begin?
- First of all, Docker does not come with the OS, so we need to install it. You can find a proper installation guide in the official [docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
- Let's go learn more about [Docker structure](./docker_structure.md).
- Well, it is time to learn the basic info commands [file_link](./INFO_COMMANDS.md)
- it is time to learn about [docker-compose](./DOCKER_COMPOSE.md)
